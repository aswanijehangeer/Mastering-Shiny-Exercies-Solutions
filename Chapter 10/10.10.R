# When you first load the app, it will work as expected because there's no previous value for input$dynamic.

# However, once you change the selectInput or textInput (which affects input$label and input$dynamic), this change will trigger the reactivity of the renderUI block.

# The reactivity will try to create a new sliderInput or numericInput with the updated label and dynamic value, but there's a circular dependency because changing input$dynamic within the renderUI block triggers the reactivity itself. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including potential errors or a non-responsive app.

# To prevent this circular dependency and ensure that the app works correctly, the isolate() function is used to separate the reactivity of input$dynamic from the reactivity of the renderUI block. This way, changing the label or type does not immediately affect input$dynamic, and it only gets updated when the appropriate input element (either sliderInput or numericInput) is created.
